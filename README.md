# Predicting Power Outage Durations
Data Science Project for DSC80 at UCSD
by Adam Walters and Kevin Garvais


# Introduction
In this project, we examined a data set compiling power outages in the U.S. dating from January 2000 - July 2016. The outages in the data set were compiled by the Department of Energy
and were known to impact at least 50,000 customers or caused an unplanned energy demand loss amounting to at least 300 MegaWatts of power. We accessed this data set from Purdue Universityâ€™s Laboratory for Advancing Sustainable Critical Infrastructure. Link to the data set: https://engineering.purdue.edu/LASCI/research-data/outages.
