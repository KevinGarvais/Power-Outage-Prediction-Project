# Predicting Power Outage Durations
Data Science Project for DSC80 at UCSD
by Adam Walters and Kevin Garvais


# Introduction
In this project, we examined a dataset compiling power outages in the U.S. dating from January 2000 - July 2016. The outages in the dataset were compiled by the Department of Energy
and were known to impact at least 50,000 customers or caused an unplanned energy demand loss amounting to at least 300 MegaWatts of power. We accessed this dataset from Purdue Universityâ€™s Laboratory for Advancing Sustainable Critical Infrastructure. Link to the dataset: https://engineering.purdue.edu/LASCI/research-data/outages.

The dataset records a plethora of information about the power outages in question. This data includes geographical, climatic, urban/rural land-use attributes, and electricity consumption and economic characteristics of the state involved.

In this project, we will first clean our dataset and come to understand it through exploratory data analysis. Then, we will analyze missingness in the dataset and missingness dependency among columns. 

This will set us up to answer our research question: What characteristics of a power outage contribute most to its duration? Continuing with this question, we will build a prediction model and will take in information about a power outage and predict its duration. This type of model would be very important for first responders and people affected by the outage so they can effectively prepare for an accurate duration of power loss.

Our original raw dataset contains 1534 rows and 57 columns, corresponding to unique outages and outage characteristics respectively.
